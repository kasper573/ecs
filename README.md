# ECS

An ECS game engine and editor built with Typescript and React.

> This project is primarily focused on making text adventure games engines with twitch.tv integration,
> but both the engine and editor is built on a generic Entity Component System and could be used
> to build other games if the proper components are developed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

- Copy .env.example to .env and replace the variables with your settings
- Run `yarn run start:game` to start the prototype game
- Run `yarn run start:editor` to start the game editor

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start:editor` or `yarn start:game`

Runs the editor or prototype game in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build:editor` or `yarn build:game`
